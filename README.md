### Hi there 👋, I'm Borja

I am a full-stack software engineer and entrepreneur with experience in large-scale web applications and back-end systems, using a variety of coding languages, frameworks, and technologies. I am self-motivated and passionate about programming, from designing system architecture to diving deep into frameworks and problem solving.

In my spare time, I am mostly adding new skills to my repertoire and sometimes open-sourcing.

```js
const { isOnline } = require('@balonsom/activity');

module.exports = {
  name: 'Borja Alonso-Majagranzas',
  email: 'balonso@hubenue.com',
  aliases: ['Me', 'balonsom'],
  languages: ['Javascript', 'Typescript', 'HTML', 'PHP', 'CSS', 'Java'],
  dailyKnowledge: ['Node', 'React', 'React Native', 'Electron', 'Mongoose', 'GraphQL', 'Express', 'Laravel'],
  getStatus: async () => {
    const online = await isOnline();
    return `Borja is currently ${online ? '🧑🏻‍💻 online' : '😴 offline, try to reach him through his email'}.`;
  },
};
```
